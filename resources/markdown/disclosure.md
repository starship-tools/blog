### Revenue from Advertising

The Starship Tools blog provides free and helpful content to users who are
interested and care about the same things that we are. We also aim to recoup
some of that investment via discrete and topically appropriate advertising
provided to our readers, useful affiliate programs, and any sponsorships that
may arise in the course of time.

However, in the event that we write reviews, earn money from avertisements in
the software and space related industries, we want to be 100% above board in
our endorsements, product reviews, and content creation efforts. This has an
impact on our ethics and ability to be a trusted source of relevant
information: we want to openly declare our revenue sources to our readers.
This way you may trust that when we say good things about a product, you know
we mean it and aren't being bought-off by companies building empires on the
crushed bones of abused bloggers and readers.

Rest assured: any time Starship Tools content contributors receive money to
write reviews, receive free products given with the intent that we would write
a review, or create any sort of content that benefits a sponsor or advertiser,
we will make an explicit disclosure of those facts on the given blog post. We
make it clearly, cleanly, and obviosuly.


### It's the Law

As bloggers passionate about space, software, complex systems and new
frontiers, we want to let you know about any potential conflicts -- it's just
the right thing to do.

However, as content creators receiving revenue or gifts through advertisement,
affiliate programs, or sponsorship, it's also the law: the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) has released guidlines for bloggers regarding endorsements
and advertising:

If at any point you feel that we could do a better job in disclosing
releationships that Starship Tools may benefit from financially, either
explicitly or implicitly, please [let us know](/contact.html).
